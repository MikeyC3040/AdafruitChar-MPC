Notes:
===========
I am not a programmer by any means, so if anyone has any issues or 
feels there's a better way of doing something, let me know

I love the work that Mopidy, Pi Music Box, Adafruit, and the creators of the Raspberry Pi.
It's a great way to mess with programming and electronics for those who aren't pro,
but are more skilled than beginner
